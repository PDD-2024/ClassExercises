# Exercise 2  
## Overview  
- Create a header file with all the constants you may need for this exercise. This file must be included in every header file made.  
- Create three classes, each with its own header file containing an interface. These three classes will be divided into Bank, Company, and Employee  
- The bank must be capable of extending credit to customers (employees) and holding funds for companies and employees. The bank will have a liquidity of $20 million. The system must be capable of facilitating money transfers.  
- Every company should have the ability to recruit new employees and integrate them into a team project. Salary must be transferred to every employee based on their project salary. The enterprise will begin with a capital of 1 million dollars and will generate profits based on the project for each one.  
- When a new employee is recruited, they will create a bank account and request a credit of 1 million dollars for a house. Half of the salary will be transferred to the bank to repay the credit.  
- The implementation of this dynamic should be included in a file named circularEconomy.cpp. A simulation of 12 months should be performed.
